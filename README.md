# Java Minesweeper

A desktop implementation of the classic Minesweeper game built using Java Swing.

## Features
- Click-based tile revealing
- Flag placement mode
- Dynamic mine generation
- Win and loss detection
- Graphical user interface using Swing

## Project Context
This was my first full solo programming project. The goal was to build a complete, working game from scratch and learn event-driven programming, state management, and debugging in Java.

The code reflects an early stage in my learning. While the UI and game logic are tightly coupled, the project was invaluable for understanding how larger programs evolve and where refactoring opportunities exist.

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Swing
- Event-driven programming

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BEarle11/java-minesweeper.git
